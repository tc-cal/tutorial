SYNC DAILY
1. git pull = PULL = Before you start work on any computer: Git ➜ Pull (download newest).
2. git add . = ADD FILES = While you work: save normally.
3. git commit -am "addingfiles" = COMMIT = When you hit a milestone (a tiny win): Git ➜ Commit… (good message like “add RSI indicator calc”).
4. git push = PUSH = When you’re done for the session: Git ➜ Push (upload).

1. Create new repo on GitHub
- git clone repo-url-you-copied # creats folder in explorer
2. Copy files into new explorer folder (.gitignore .gitdaily .reference)
- git add . # adds any newly made files into explorer
- git commit -am "adding files" #
- git push
3. Create new .venv in setting => interpreter


GOTCHAS
“I pushed but other PC doesn’t see it.” You probably didn’t Push (you only committed). On the other PC, also Pull.
“PyCharm shows weird .idea changes.” Keep .idea/ in .gitignore (already listed). That keeps IDE noise out of Git.
“Large file (>100MB) push failed.” GitHub blocks big files. Use Git LFS or keep data (like raw CSVs) outside the repo and load from disk.
“Merge conflict.” You and Future-You changed the same lines on two devices. PyCharm will open a 3-way merge tool. Pick the correct lines, save, Commit, then Push.
“Forgot to ignore secrets.” Put API keys in a .env file and make sure .env is in .gitignore.
“Wrong remote.” Check Git ➜ Manage Remotes… (the “origin” URL should point to your GitHub repo).
“Interpreter missing on new machine.” Create a new venv and reinstall dependencies; code will run.
